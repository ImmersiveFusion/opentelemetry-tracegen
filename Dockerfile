# Container image for TraceGen (the OTLP trace generator).
# Multi-stage: build the static Go binary, then ship it on a distroless base.
# Built + pushed to Docker Hub (immersivefusion/tracegen) by .github/workflows/release.yml
# on a version-tag push. Multi-arch via buildx (TARGETOS/TARGETARCH).
#
# Usage on a cluster (the binary takes the same flags as the CLI):
#   docker run --rm immersivefusion/tracegen -endpoint <collector:4317> -insecure ...
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
