# OpenTelemetry Trace Generator

A single-binary distributed trace generator that produces realistic, topology-rich OTLP traces and correlated logs. No Docker Compose, no microservices to deploy, no infrastructure - just one executable (or a 5.7 MB container) that simulates a full e-commerce platform with up to 28 services, dozens of pods that scale with the topology, and 40 scenario flows - including AI agentic scenarios with full OTel GenAI semantic conventions. Three complexity levels (light/normal/heavy) let you scale from a clean 10-service demo to the full topology with AI.

Built for testing observability platforms, load testing trace pipelines, and showcasing distributed system visualizations - for both traditional APM and LLM observability.

## Why This Exists

Every existing trace generator falls into one of two categories:

1. **Flat span generators** (telemetrygen, tracepusher) - produce uniform, identical spans with no service topology
2. **Full demo apps** (OTel Astronomy Shop, Jaeger HotROD) - require Docker Compose with 15+ containers and ~6GB RAM

And none of them generate **AI agentic traces**. The LLM observability market has no standalone tool that combines traditional APM with LLM observability. Every specialized LLM tool (Langfuse, LangSmith, Helicone, Arize, Traceloop, Portkey, Galileo) tracks token usage, model costs, and agent tool calls - but none of them provide traditional distributed tracing.

This tool generates **topology-rich, failure-injectable traces from a single binary** - covering both traditional microservice flows AND AI agentic patterns with OTel GenAI semantic conventions. One binary proves that a platform can visualize both.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Download the latest release (or build from source)
go install github.com/ImmersiveFusion/if-opentelemetry-tracegen/cmd/tracegen@latest

# Send to a local OTLP collector (Jaeger, Tempo, etc.)
tracegen -insecure

# Send to a remote endpoint with auth headers
tracegen -endpoint your-otlp-endpoint:443 -headers "api-key=YOUR_KEY"

# Or set headers via the standard OTel environment variable
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="api-key=YOUR_KEY"
tracegen -endpoint your-otlp-endpoint:443
```

**Why the install path says `if-opentelemetry-tracegen`:** that is the Go module path declared in `go.mod`, and a module path is a public contract rather than a link. It keeps working for everyone who has already pinned it, so it deliberately stays as-is even though the repository is now named `opentelemetry-tracegen`. Please do not "fix" it to match the repo name.

> **See it in 3D** - Send traces to [DeepCube (TM)](https://deepcube.ai) (`tracegen -endpoint otlp.deepcube.ai:443 -headers "api-key=YOUR_KEY"`, [how to get a key](https://docs.deepcube.ai/Getting-Started/Api-Key/)) to explore them as a 3D force-directed graph, drill into conventional trace waterfalls for detailed analysis, and get AI-assisted insights from [Tessa](https://deepcube.ai). For a ready-made example without any setup, try the [OpenTelemetry Chaos Simulator](https://github.com/ImmersiveFusion/opentelemetry-chaos-sim) at [chaos.deepcube.ai](https://chaos.deepcube.ai) - a fully interactive sandbox with visual failure injection.

## Live demo grids — see it running

![The seven demo grids streaming live, in motion](.img/tracegen.gif)

Seven always-on demo grids stream live OpenTelemetry traces into DeepCube's 3D player right now — a clean baseline, an AI-native app, a blended environment, phantom-service detection, an AI-outage, and a full incident. Each grid is this container, deployed declaratively via GitOps (Argo CD) in the Immersive Fusion cloud — multi-arch and distroless, one matrix row per grid, shipping to `otlp.deepcube.ai:443`.

**See them in 3D:** the full experience is [DeepCube](https://docs.deepcube.ai/DC/3D/), the immersive 3D client: install it and open a grid to walk the live traces. On mobile or can't install right now? [DeepCube Web](https://docs.deepcube.ai/DC/Web/) runs the same grids in your browser at [portal.deepcube.ai](https://portal.deepcube.ai).

| **Conversational Commerce** | Multi-turn session (10-14 spans/turn) | Growing context tokens, session continuity |

> **Note:** Failed Payment, Saga Compensation, Timeout Cascade, lost messages, and retry storms only activate when `-errors > 0`. AI error scenarios (rate limits, hallucinated tool calls, token budget exceeded, content filter blocks) also require `-errors > 0`.

### Correlated Logs

Every service emits OTel log records via OTLP alongside traces. Logs are automatically correlated with the active span context (trace_id, span_id), so your APM platform can link logs to the exact span that produced them.

- **ERROR** logs are emitted alongside every exception event (cache failures, DB errors, payment declines, LLM rate limits, agent failures)
- **WARN** logs fire on auth failures, content moderation flags, payment retries, and LLM fallbacks
- **INFO** logs cover request entry points, payment processing, fraud analysis, agent invocations, and iteration progress

Disable with `-no-logs` to emit traces only.

### OTel GenAI Semantic Conventions

All AI scenarios emit spans following [OTel GenAI Semantic Conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/) and matching the exact span shapes produced by [Microsoft Semantic Kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/concepts/enterprise-readiness/observability/) and [Microsoft Agent Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/agents/observability).

**Span types:**

| Span Name Pattern | SpanKind | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `chat {model}` | CLIENT | `chat gpt-4o` |
| `embedding {model}` | CLIENT | `embedding text-embedding-3-small` |
| `invoke_agent {name}` | CLIENT | `invoke_agent CustomerSupportAgent` |
| `execute_tool {name}` | INTERNAL | `execute_tool get_order_status` |
| `{operation} {collection}` | CLIENT | `query product-embeddings` |

**Attributes on every LLM span:**

- `gen_ai.system` - LLM provider (e.g., `openai`)
- `gen_ai.request.model` / `gen_ai.response.model` - model requested and used
- `gen_ai.usage.input_tokens` / `gen_ai.usage.output_tokens` - token consumption
- `gen_ai.response.finish_reasons` - completion reason (`stop`, `tool_calls`, `length`, `content_filter`)
- `gen_ai.response.id` - unique response identifier
- `gen_ai.request.temperature`, `gen_ai.request.max_tokens` - request parameters

**Agent-specific attributes:**

- `gen_ai.agent.id` / `gen_ai.agent.name` / `gen_ai.agent.description` - agent identity
- `gen_ai.conversation.id` - session linking for multi-turn interactions
- `gen_ai.tool.name` / `gen_ai.tool.type` / `gen_ai.tool.call.id` - tool call tracking
- `gen_ai.data_source.id` - RAG data source identifier
- `gen_ai.request.embedding.dimensions` - embedding dimensions

These attributes match what every LLM observability tool on the market tracks - enabling direct comparison of visualization capabilities.

### Chaos & Failure Injection

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Lost messages** | 5% chance per queue hop that the consumer never fires - trace ends abruptly |
| **Dead consumer mode** | `-no-consumers` flag: producers fire, consumers never pick up |
| **Retry storms** | Payment retries 3x with exponential backoff before saga compensation |
| **Timeout cascades** | Search service times out, gateway returns 504, circuit breaker serves stale cache |
| **Saga compensation** | Payment fails after order+inventory committed - triggers 4-way parallel rollback |
| **LLM rate limits** | OpenAI 429 with token budget details, fallback to text search |
| **Hallucinated tool calls** | Agent requests non-existent tool, triggers error handling |
| **Token budget exceeded** | Agent exceeds iteration token limit, graceful degradation |
| **Content filter blocks** | Safety classifier blocks content, alternate flow triggered |
| **Tunable error rate** | `-errors 0` (none) to `-errors 10` (chaos) with realistic .NET stack traces |

### Realistic Details

The generated traces simulate a .NET-based e-commerce platform with AI capabilities. Stack traces and library names reflect the .NET ecosystem by design.

- **Stack traces**: Npgsql, StackExchange.Redis, Stripe SDK, Elasticsearch.Net, System.Net.Http, OpenAI SDK, Qdrant client
- **Database operations**: PostgreSQL INSERT/SELECT/UPDATE with semantic conventions
- **Cache operations**: Redis GET/SET/HSET/MSET/DEL with TTL and key attributes
- **Messaging**: RabbitMQ and Kafka with producer/consumer span kinds and queue delays
- **External APIs**: Stripe charges, SendGrid email, UPS shipping, OpenAI chat/embeddings
- **LLM operations**: Chat completions, embeddings, agent tool calls with token tracking
- **Vector search**: Qdrant similarity search with cosine distance, dimension validation
- **Agent orchestration**: Plan/act/reflect loops, tool dispatch, session management
- **Content moderation**: Safety classifiers, PII detection, guardrail enforcement
- **ML inference**: Fraud detection model scoring with feature counts
- **Feature flags**: Config service checks that gate behavior

## Usage

```
tracegen [flags]

Flags:
  -endpoint string     OTLP gRPC endpoint host:port (default "localhost:4317")
  -headers string      OTLP headers as key=value pairs, comma-separated (or set OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS)
  -complexity string   Topology complexity: light, normal, heavy (default "normal")
  -level int           Aggressiveness 1-10 (default 1)
  -errors int          Error rate 0-10 (default 0)
  -no-consumers        Disable all async consumers
  -no-ai-backends      Disable LLM/AI backends (AI spans emit errors)
  -ai-only             Only run AI agentic scenarios
  -no-logs             Disable OTel log record emission (traces only)
  -insecure            Use plaintext gRPC (no TLS) for local backends
  -log-level string    Console verbosity: silent, error, info, debug (default "info")
  -quiet               Errors only (alias for -log-level=error); silences the periodic "traces sent" heartbeat
```

> **Console verbosity.** `silent`/`error` suppress the periodic heartbeat. The startup banner ("what it's doing") and genuine errors/fatal exits always print to stderr at any level. You can also set it with the `TRACEGEN_LOG_LEVEL` env var (handy for containers). Precedence: `-quiet` > `-log-level` > `TRACEGEN_LOG_LEVEL` > default (`info`). The published container image defaults to `TRACEGEN_LOG_LEVEL=error` so it doesn't spam logs; the bare CLI stays `info`. Override with `-e TRACEGEN_LOG_LEVEL=info` (or `-log-level` / `-quiet`).

### Complexity Levels

| Complexity | Services | Pods | Scenarios | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **light** | 10 core | ~20 (min replicas) | 6 | Clean demos, small graphs |
| **normal** | 20 traditional | ~40 | 16 | General testing, full e-commerce |
| **heavy** | 28 (+ AI) | 59 | 20 (of 40 defined) | Full topology with AI agentic flows |

**Light** includes only the e-commerce backbone: web-frontend, api-gateway, order-service, payment-service, inventory-service, user-service, cache-service, auth-service, product-service, and cart-service. Scenarios are limited to the core flows (Create Order, Search & Browse, User Login, Add to Cart, Full Checkout, Health Check).

**Normal** (default) adds all remaining traditional services and scenarios including chaos/failure modes.

**Heavy** adds all 8 AI services and 4 of the 12 AI agentic scenarios (RAG Search, AI Chatbot, Content Moderation, Multi-Step Agent).

### Aggressiveness Levels

| Level | Label | Rate |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | whisper | ~2 traces/s |
| 2 | gentle | ~3 traces/s |
| 3 | calm | ~3 traces/s |
| 4 | moderate | ~5 traces/s |
| 5 | steady | ~7 traces/s |
| 6 | brisk | ~15 traces/s |
| 7 | aggressive | ~21 traces/s |
| 8 | intense | ~40 traces/s |
| 9 | firehose | ~83 traces/s |

## Design Decisions

### Why AI Agentic Scenarios?

The LLM observability market is growing rapidly, but every specialized tool focuses exclusively on LLM workloads. No standalone LLM observability tool provides traditional APM capabilities. The only platforms addressing both are legacy APM giants (Datadog, New Relic, Dynatrace) adding LLM features to existing products.

This trace generator produces both traditional distributed traces AND AI agentic traces from the same binary - proving that a single platform can visualize both. The AI scenarios emit the exact same telemetry signals that Langfuse, LangSmith, Helicone, Arize, Traceloop, Portkey, and Galileo track.

### Why Microsoft Semantic Kernel / Agent Framework Alignment?

Microsoft's Semantic Kernel and Agent Framework are the most widely adopted .NET AI frameworks. Their OTel instrumentation emits exactly three span types: `invoke_agent {name}`, `chat {model}`, and `execute_tool {function}`. Our AI scenarios produce traces structurally identical to what a real Semantic Kernel / Agent Framework application would emit - so observability platforms can be tested against realistic .NET AI workloads.

### Why OTel GenAI Semantic Conventions?

The [OTel GenAI Semantic Conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/) are being adopted across the ecosystem. Langfuse SDK v3 is OTel-native, LangSmith added OTel support, Arize Phoenix uses OTel instrumentation, and Traceloop's OpenLLMetry conventions were adopted into the official OTel spec. Building on these conventions ensures the generated traces are compatible with every tool that adopts the standard.
