# Contributing to TraceGen

Thanks for your interest in TraceGen — a single-binary OpenTelemetry trace generator. Bug reports, feature ideas, code, and docs are all welcome.

## Ways to contribute

- **Report a bug** or **request a feature** — open an issue with one of the [issue templates](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE).
- **Add your deployment** — running TraceGen somewhere? Add it to [`WHERE-TRACEGEN-RUNS.md`](WHERE-TRACEGEN-RUNS.md) via a pull request, or use the "Add a deployment" issue template and we'll add it for you.
- **Send a pull request** — see below.

## Building from source

TraceGen is a single Go module with no runtime dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ImmersiveFusion/opentelemetry-tracegen.git
cd opentelemetry-tracegen
go build -o tracegen ./cmd/tracegen
./tracegen -insecure   # send to a local collector on localhost:4317
```

Cross-compile for another platform:

```bash
GOOS=linux   GOARCH=arm64 go build -o tracegen     ./cmd/tracegen
GOOS=darwin  GOARCH=arm64 go build -o tracegen     ./cmd/tracegen
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o tracegen.exe ./cmd/tracegen
```

## Pull requests

1. Fork the repo and branch from `main`.
2. Keep changes focused — one logical change per PR.
3. Run `go build ./...` and `go vet ./...` before pushing.
4. Use clear, conventional commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, …).
5. Open the PR against `main` and describe what changed and why.

## Releasing

Releases are cut by pushing a version tag. The CI workflow
([`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml)) builds the
cross-platform binaries, publishes a GitHub Release, and pushes the multi-arch
container image to Docker Hub.

**Tag format: use the `v`-prefixed form, e.g. `v0.7.4`.** This is the canonical
scheme going forward (it matches the Go ecosystem and what GoReleaser expects).

```bash
git tag v0.7.4
git push origin v0.7.4
```

The trigger also still accepts the older bare-number form (`0.7.4`) for
backward compatibility with historical tags, but new releases should always be
`v`-prefixed so the Tags/Releases lists stay consistent and sort cleanly.

Note: the workflow evaluates the tag trigger **at the moment the tag is
pushed**. If a tag was pushed before a trigger fix landed on `main`, fixing the
trigger does not retroactively run it — push a new (higher) version tag instead.

## Reporting issues

Use the issue templates. For bugs, include your platform/architecture, the exact `tracegen` command and flags, and what you expected versus what happened. `-log-level debug` gives more detail.

## Code of conduct

Be decent. We follow the spirit of the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/): no harassment, assume good faith, keep it about the work.
